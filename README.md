#Code of Conduct:
Inform all group memebers if there is any reason that you need to cancel a meeting at least 12hrs before the meeting.
Do not fail to turn up to a meeting or a checkpoint meetup, unless for valid reason.
Always contribute to meetings and to the deligated sections of the project.
Ask for help or ask if others need help in the  group, make sure that no one is struggling.
